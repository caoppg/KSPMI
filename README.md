# KSPMI

A Knowledge-based System for PredictiveMaintenance in Industry 4.0 (KSPMI), the work is funded by the European Interrg HALFBACK Project (http://halfback.in.hs-furtwangen.de/home/).

## Getting Started

To run this software, you can do the following steps:

* Download the project as a zip file.
* Unzip the file.
* Import the unzipped folder as a maven project, into a JAVA integrated development environment (IDE), such as Eclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, or BlueJ.
* Navigate to the SoftwareAPP class under the halfback.prototype package
* Run with command line arguments. The arguments should follow a format such as: -p -if D:\XX\XX\XX\KSPMI-master\data\dataset -of D:\XX\XX\XX\KSPMI-master\result.txt -m 0.8. In the arguments, local dictionary after "-if" indicates the path of input dataset, and the path after "-of" should be the local dictionary of the project. The last float number "0.8" gives a pre-defined support value for the chronicle mining algorithm. 

### Prerequisites
